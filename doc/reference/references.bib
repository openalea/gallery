abstract = {In this paper, we present PlantGL, an open-source graphic toolkit for the creation, simulation and analysis of 3D virtual plants. This C++ geometric library is embedded in the Python language which makes it a powerful user-interactive platform for plant modeling in various biological application domains. PlantGL makes it possible to build and manipulate geometric models of plants or plant parts, ranging from tissues and organs to plant populations. Based on a scene graph augmented with primitives dedicated to plant representation, several methods are provided to create plant architectures from either field measurements or procedural algorithms. Because they are particularly useful in plant design and analysis, special attention has been paid to the definition and use of branching system envelopes. Several examples from different modelling applications illustrate how PlantGL can be used to construct, analyse or manipulate geometric models at different scales ranging from tissues to plant communities.}

  abstract = {Water uptake by roots is a key adaptation of plants to aerial life. Water uptake depends on root system architecture (RSA) and tissue hydraulic properties that, together, shape the root hydraulic architecture. This work investigates how the interplay between conductivities along radial (e.g. aquaporins) and axial (e.g. xylem vessels) pathways determines the water transport properties of highly branched RSAs as found in adult Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. A hydraulic model named HydroRoot was developed, based on multi-scale tree graph representations of RSAs. Root water flow was measured by the pressure chamber technique after successive cuts of a same root system from the tip toward the base. HydroRoot model inversion in corresponding RSAs allowed us to concomitantly determine radial and axial conductivities, providing evidence that the latter is often overestimated by classical evaluation based on the Hagen-Poiseuille law. Organizing principles of Arabidopsis primary and lateral root growth and branching were determined and used to apply the HydroRoot model to an extended set of simulated RSAs. Sensitivity analyses revealed that water transport can be co-limited by radial and axial conductances throughout the whole RSA. The number of roots that can be sectioned (intercepted) at a given distance from the base was defined as an accessible and informative indicator of RSA. The overall set of experimental and theoretical procedures was applied to plants mutated in ESKIMO1 and previously shown to have xylem collapse. This approach will be instrumental to dissect the root water transport phenotype of plants with intricate alterations in root growth or transport functions.},

  abstract = {Root water uptake is driven by a combination of hydrostatic and osmotic forces. Water transport was characterized in primary roots of maize seedlings grown hydroponically under standard and water deficit (WD) conditions, as induced by addition of 150 g l-1 polyethylene glycol 8000 (water potential= -0.336 MPa). Flow measurements were performed using the pressure chamber technique in intact roots or on progressively cut root system architectures. To account for the concomitant transport of water and solutes in roots under WD, we developed within realistic root system architectures a hydraulic tree model integrating both solute pumping and leak. This model explains the high spontaneous sap exudation of roots grown in standard conditions, the non-linearity of pressure-flow relationships, and negative fluxes observed under WD conditions at low external hydrostatic pressure. The model also reveals the heterogeneity of driving forces and elementary radial flows throughout the root system architecture, and how this heterogeneity depends on both plant treatment and water transport mode. The full set of flow measurement data obtained from individual roots grown under standard or WD conditions was used in an inverse modeling approach to determine their respective radial and axial hydraulic conductivities. This approach allows resolution of the dramatic effects of WD on these two components.},
