# Getting Started

**OpenAlea** is a software platform dedicated to the analysis, modelling and simulation of Functional-Structural Plant Models.

OpenAlea is built by a community of researchers and labs around the world ,lead by three french research institutes : CIRAD, INRAE, and inria.

## What's in OpenAlea ?
* **formalisms** used to represent plant architecture (MTG), visualise it in 3D (plantgl), simulate the growth and development of plants (LPy), and analyse its structure (StructureAnalysis)
* **models** in ecophysiology and biophysics
* **use cases** to adapt formalisms and models for a given community and application. Some applications are 
    - Root and Shoot Phenotyping
    - GxE Cereals
    - GxE Orchards
    - Plant-Pathosystem interaction 
    - Intercropping
    - Agroforestery

In this book, we will explore :
* Basic formalisms (MTG, PlantGL, LPy)
* Model presentation
* Use Case illustration
